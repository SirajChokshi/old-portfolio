While this scenario is just overcomplicated arithmetic there are actual advantages\nto the functional paradigm. Note we avoid defining variables with 'var' or 'let' and instead opt for 'const' which is cannot be reassigned, I'll talk more about this shortly.</p>\n<h2>Advantages of Functional Programming</h2>\n<p>Functional programming is nothing new. Being modeled after lambda calculus and mathematical functions, functional programming languages\nlike LISP and Haskell have been around for over 60 and 30 years respectively</p>\n<h3>No Side Effects</h3>\n<p>Functional programming opts for programming without side effects. Much like a mathematical function functional programming takes input(s) and returns one or more outputs.</p>\n<h3>Code Readability</h3>\n<h2>Why use JavaScript?</h2>\n<h2>Using ES6 for</h2>\n<h2>Why Not to Use Functional Programming</h2>\n<p>Lastly, while functional programming can be a valuable item in a developer's toolbox, the most valuable tool, as corny as it sounds, is judgement.\nThrowing new, exciting, or complicated technology at one's issues is not the most productive way to go about solving a problem. It is the same reason\nthere are multiple paradigms in use and more than one language implementation for each paradigm.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"March 31, 2020","path":"/blog/functional-javascript-es6","title":"Why and how to write Functional JavaScript with ES6","tags":["javascript","programming"],"abstract":"ES6 allows for integratation functional programming in existing programs.","photo":"https://picsum.photos/800/500"}},"allMarkdownRemark":{"edges":[{"node":{"id":"0f61bcf5-fb0a-5604-a2f9-06e6cfde7582","excerpt":"What is Functional Programming?
